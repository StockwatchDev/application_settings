The toml format is human-oriented, flexible, standardardized and not overly complex. It supports comments, and hence parameters can be easily documented in a toml file. However, when parameters are initialized by reading from a toml file, then changed (because it concerns settings) and subsequently written to file again for persistance, the comments will be lost. Therefore, it does not make much sense to add documenting comments to a settings file. Because config parameters are read-only, comments in a config file will not get lost and do make sense. Because of this, the default format for storing config parameters is toml . The name of a config file equals config.toml by default. JSON is a standardized, lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is a bit less straightforward to document parameters in this format, which makes it less human-oriented than toml , but it is used widely for data interchange between automated systems. Because of this, the default format for storing settings parameters is json . The name of a settings file equals settings.json by default. The examples introduced in the previous section can for example be initialized with the following files. config.toml file for the configuration example settings.json file for the settings example [section1] # Use this section to set the config that you prefer by editing the file # field1 has default value 'field1' field1 = \"my own version of the first field\" # field2 has default value 2 field2 = 22 { \"basics\" : { \"name\" : \"the stored name\" , \"totals\" : 3 } } The fieldnames of a Container class are found as: the section names in the toml file the member names of the root object in the json file The fieldnames of a Section class are found as: the fieldnames inside the corresponding section in the toml file the member names of the object that is the value of the name that represents the section in the json file The order of sections and/or fields in the file does not have to adhere to the order in which fields have been specified in the Container - or Section classes. Presence of sections and/or fields in the files that are not defined in the classes goes by silently. Fields or complete sections defined in the classes can be absent in the files as long as default values have been specified for all fields that have been left out. Location, name and type of the file By default, the config and settings file are located in a subfolder of the home folder of the user running the application. The default name of that subfolder is provided by the default_foldername() method and consists of a dot, followed by a name derived from your container class: the word Config / Settings is removed, underscores are put in front of capitals (except for the first letter) and all letters are made lower case. For example, the Container class MyExampleConfig by default will store its config in ~/.my_example/config.toml . And MyExampleSettings will default to a settings file ~/.my_example/settings.json . If you want the files to be stored in a different location and/or have a different name and/or change the format, then you can use the method set_filepath : # the next statement sets the location, name and format of the settings file # the argument can be eiter a string or a Path MyExampleSettings . set_filepath ( r \"C:\\ProgramData\\testsettings.toml\" ) The extension of the file is used to select the format for parsing and hence has to be either json , JSON , toml or TOML .","title":"3.

Therefore, implementation has been done as follows: The instance of a parameter container is accessed via a class method get() ; The parameter value is then obtained by chaining with the section name and the parameter name; The first invocation of get() will create the container instance, try to read values from file and store it for future access in a private module global (a dictionary with the class id as key); A parameter container should not be instantiated directly by client code (although it is possible to do so, e.g. for testing purposes); If needed, you can set the path for the parameter file before the first invocation of get() . Changing parameter values Parameters are defined as fields of frozen dataclasses. Hence, changing parameter values by means of straightforward assignment will raise an error. Config parameters are meant to be read only. Changing values of such parameters has to be done by editing the config file and restarting your application or reloading the config container. Obviously, settings parameters can also be changed by editing the settings file and restarting the application or reloading the settings container. In addition to that, settings can be changed programmatically by calling a class method update(changes: dict[str, dict[str, Any]) , where the argument changes is a dictionary of dictionaries that specifies the sections (keys of the outer dict) and fields (keys of the inner dicts) that are changed. The method update will replace the stored settings in the private module global with an updated instance and the settings file will be updated as well. So the invocation of get() after update or application restart or reloading will return the changed parameter values.
