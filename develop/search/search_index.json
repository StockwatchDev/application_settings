The difference between configuration and settings is as follows. Config is for parameters that do not change during runtime and are read from file. Settings are parameters that can change programmatically during runtime and are read from and saved to file for persistancy over sessions. During definition, they differ only in terms of the base classes that are used. The intended structure is that parameters are defined in section classes. Sections can be nested. There should be one special root section for the application, referred to as the container, that handles file storage. Config sections and Settings sections should never be mixed (i.e., do not nest a Settings section in a Config section and vice versa). Defining non-container section(s) A section is defined by subclassing the relevant base class ( ConfigSectionBase for config, SettingsSectionBase for settings) and decorating it with @dataclass(frozen=True) . Parameters are defined as fields of the dataclass. For a dataclass, it is mandatory to add a type hint for each field. These type hints are used also to validate the data that is read from the parameter file. If you specify a default value as well, then you prevent the occurance of an exception if the value for the parameter of concern is not found in the parameter file. The dataclass decorator provided by application_settings is actually an exported pydantic.dataclasses.dataclass , which is a drop-in replacement for a dataclass from the standard python library, enhanced with data validation. If you need additional dataclass functionality such as fields etc., you can import those from the standard library. Nested sections are obtained by defining fields in a section that are type hinted with the appropriate contained section class(es) and instantiated (possible only when all parameters of the nested section have default values). Defining the container The container is a special section that is to be the root for parametrisation of an application. It is defined likewise: by subclassing the relevant base class ( ConfigBase for config, SettingsBase for settings), decorating it with @dataclass(frozen=True) , defining fields for parameters and nested non-root sections. Note that albeit settings can be changed programmatically, we still set frozen=True for the settings container and -sections (see also the example section below).

Currently, two formats are supported for persistent storage of parameters: toml and json . The toml format is human-oriented, flexible, standardardized and not overly complex. It supports comments, and hence parameters can be easily documented in a toml file. However, when parameters are initialized by reading from a toml file, then changed (because it concerns settings) and subsequently written to file again for persistance, the comments will be lost. Therefore, it does not make much sense to add documenting comments to a settings file. Because config parameters are read-only, comments in a config file will not get lost and do make sense. Because of this, the default format for storing config parameters is toml . The name of a config file equals config.toml by default. JSON is a standardized, lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is a bit less straightforward to document parameters in this format, which makes it less human-oriented than toml , but it is used widely for data interchange between automated systems. Because of this, the default format for storing settings parameters is json . The name of a settings file equals settings.json by default. The examples introduced in the previous chapter can for example be initialized with the following files. config.toml file for the configuration example settings.json file for the settings example # Use this file to set the config that you prefer by editing the file name = \"application specific name\" [section1] # field1 has default value 0.5 field1 = -0 .5 # field2 has default value 2 field2 = 22 { \"name\" : \"the stored name\" , \"basics\" : { \"totals\" : 3 } } The field names of a Container class are found as: the root parameter names and the section names in the toml file the member names of the root object in the json file The field names of a Section class are found as: the parameter names inside the corresponding section in the toml file the member names of the object that is the value of the name that represents the section in the json file The order of sections and/or fields in the file does not have to adhere to the order in which fields have been specified in the Container - or Section classes. Presence of sections and/or fields in the files that are not defined in the classes goes by silently. Fields or complete sections defined in the classes can be absent in the files as long as default values have been specified for all fields that have been left out. For more info on data validation click here Location, name and type of the file By default, the config and settings files are located in a subfolder of the home folder of the user running the application. The default name of that subfolder is provided by the default_foldername() method and consists of a dot, followed by a name derived from your container class: the word Config / Settings is removed, underscores are put in front of capitals (except for the first letter) and all letters are made lower case. For example, the Container class MyExampleConfig by default will store its config in ~/.my_example/config.toml . And MyExampleSettings will default to a settings file ~/.my_example/settings.json . If you want the files to be stored in a different location and/or have a different name and/or change the format, then you can use the method set_filepath . If you invoke this method but you have already instantiated the parameters via load() or get() , then you most likely want to reload them. You can do so by setting an argument load=True in set_filepath . If you invoke this function after parameters have been instantiated and do not set load=True , then a warning is printed. Example: # the next statement sets the location, name and format of the settings file # the argument can be eiter a string or a Path MyExampleSettings . set_filepath ( r \"C:\\ProgramData\\testsettings.toml\" ) # the next statement loads the settings MyExampleSettings . load () # the next statement sets a new name for the settings file and reloads it MyExampleSettings . set_filepath ( r \"C:\\ProgramData\\productionsettings.toml\" , load = True ) # the next statement resets the filepath to the default, doesn't load but generates a warning MyExampleSettings . set_filepath ( \"\" ) The extension of the file is used to select the format for parsing and hence has to be either json , JSON , toml or TOML . Setting the filepath via command-line arguments A quite common scenario is to launch an application from the command-line and to specify the config file and/or settings file as argument(s). Convenience functions are available to support this using the argparse module from the standard library: a function config_filepath_from_cli is available that will define a command-line argument that takes exactly one additional argument, namely the config filepath. You have to specify the Config class when calling this function, and you may pass a parser (default: the main argument parser) and your own short option (default: \"-c\" ) and long option (default: \"--config_filepath\" ) and you may set load=True (default: False ). If the option is indeed supplied when the application is launched, then the config filepath is set using set_filepath and the value for load is passed into this function. a function settings_filepath_from_cli is available that will define a command-line argument that takes exactly one additional argument, namely the settings filepath. You have to specify the Settings class when calling this function, and you may pass a parser (default: the main argument parser) and your own short option (default: \"-s\" ) and long option (default: \"--settings_filepath\" ) and you may set load=True (default: False ). If the option is indeed supplied when the application is launched, then the config filepath is set using set_filepath and the value for load is passed into this function. a function parameters_folderpath_from_cli is also available and comes in handy when you have a config file and a settings file in the same folder. This function will define a command-line argument that takes exactly one additional argument, namely the path of the folder that holds both files. Note that this implies that the config- and settings file have to have the default filename. You have to specify both the Settings class and the Config class when calling this function, and you may pass a parser (default: the main argument parser) and your own short option (default: \"-p\" ) and long option (default: \"--parameters_folderpath\" ) and you may set load=True (default: False ). If the option is indeed supplied when the application is launched, then the config and the settings filepath are set using set_filepath and the value for load is passed into these functions. CLI for config filepath CLI for settings filepath CLI for common config and settings folder from application_settings import config_filepath_from_cli # The next line defines a cli argument \"-c\" and \"--config_filepath\" # and specifies that the config should be loaded when it is specified config_filepath_from_cli ( MyExampleConfig , load = True ) # the application launch with config file spec could be something like: # application_name -c C:\\ProgramData\\productionconfig.toml from application_settings import settings_filepath_from_cli # The next line defines a cli argument \"-s\" and \"--settings_filepath\" # and specifies that the settings should be loaded when it is specified settings_filepath_from_cli ( MyExampleSettings , load = True ) # the application launch with settings file spec could be something like: # application_name -s C:\\ProgramData\\productionsettings.json from application_settings import parameters_folderpath_from_cli # The next line defines a cli argument \"-p\" and \"--parameters_folderpath\" # and specifies that the config and settings should be loaded when it is specified parameters_folderpath_from_cli ( MyExampleConfig , MyExampleSettings , load = True ) # the application launch with folder spec could be something like: # application_name -p C:\\ProgramData Handling FileNotFoundError When loading a parameter file, you have a choice what should happen when the parameter file is not found in the location that has been specified: if you load(throw_if_file_not_found = False) , then the FileNotFoundError is catched by application_settings , an error message is generated and program flow is continued by trying to instantiate the config / settings using default values. If you have defined parameters without default values, a TypeError exception will be raised. if you load(throw_if_file_not_found = True) , then the FileNotFoundError exception is thrown and the application can decide how this situation should be handled. The default value for throw_if_file_not_found is False , hence load() will not throw an exception when the parameter file is not found. Note that if you do not explicitly use load but rather implicitly call it via get() or set_filepath() , then this default behavior will also be obtained.","title":"3.

Convenience functions are available to support this using the argparse module from the standard library: a function config_filepath_from_cli is available that will define a command-line argument that takes exactly one additional argument, namely the config filepath. You have to specify the Config class when calling this function, and you may pass a parser (default: the main argument parser) and your own short option (default: \"-c\" ) and long option (default: \"--config_filepath\" ) and you may set load=True (default: False ). If the option is indeed supplied when the application is launched, then the config filepath is set using set_filepath and the value for load is passed into this function. a function settings_filepath_from_cli is available that will define a command-line argument that takes exactly one additional argument, namely the settings filepath. You have to specify the Settings class when calling this function, and you may pass a parser (default: the main argument parser) and your own short option (default: \"-s\" ) and long option (default: \"--settings_filepath\" ) and you may set load=True (default: False ). If the option is indeed supplied when the application is launched, then the config filepath is set using set_filepath and the value for load is passed into this function. a function parameters_folderpath_from_cli is also available and comes in handy when you have a config file and a settings file in the same folder. This function will define a command-line argument that takes exactly one additional argument, namely the path of the folder that holds both files. Note that this implies that the config- and settings file have to have the default filename. You have to specify both the Settings class and the Config class when calling this function, and you may pass a parser (default: the main argument parser) and your own short option (default: \"-p\" ) and long option (default: \"--parameters_folderpath\" ) and you may set load=True (default: False ). If the option is indeed supplied when the application is launched, then the config and the settings filepath are set using set_filepath and the value for load is passed into these functions.

Therefore, implementation has been done as follows: By in voking method load() on a parameter container class, the container and all contained (nested) sections are instantiated with data values read from the parameter file. The instances are stored for future access in a private module global (a dictionary with the class id as key); The instance of a parameter container or section is accessed via a class method get() ; The parameter value is then obtained by chaining with (the section name(s) and) the parameter name; If a container has not been loaded, the first invocation of get() will do that automatically. This is not the case for a section - if get() is invoked on a section before any loading has been done, it will be instantiated with default values; A parameter container should not be instantiated directly by client code (although it is possible to do so, e.g. for testing purposes); If needed, you can set the path for the parameter file before the first invocation of get() (see chapter on files ). Changing parameter values Parameters are defined as fields of frozen dataclasses. Hence, changing parameter values by means of straightforward assignment will raise an error. Config parameters are meant to be read only. Changing values of such parameters has to be done by editing the config file and restarting your application or reloading the config container. Obviously, settings parameters can also be changed by editing the settings file and restarting the application or reloading the settings container. In addition to that, settings can be changed programmatically by calling a class method update(changes: dict[str, dict[str, Any]) , where the argument changes is a dictionary in which each key is the name of a parameter that is to be updated. For updating a nested section, the key needs to hold the section name and the value should hold a dictionary with str-type keys again, etc. The method update will replace the stored settings in the private module global with an updated instance and the settings file will be updated as well. So the invocation of get() after update or application restart or reloading will return the changed parameter values.
